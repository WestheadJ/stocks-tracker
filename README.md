## What is it?
This program I decided to start due to my job (current job of writing this) in hospitality. Our reporting systems are horrendous at giving proper information in a visible way. So I wanted to see our top moving items quickly, but also practice my coding skills and data manipulation.

## What it is using
I am using python as the main language mainly down to the fact of I wanted to learn more scripting, it is also well know for it's use in data science and data manipulation. It is using duckdb to store the data, which pairs well with using pandas and numpy for quick querying and having custom functions.
